### First draft

- read in sites with locations in a country to a datframe
- read in raster of FWI, using X sample dates for the past year
- use [geopandas sampling](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/sampling.html) to get the raster values for each site location
- for each sampled raster set the date of the dataframe and concat the data to the existing data
- groupby date, getting the min, mean and max ast the values for each date
- plot the line/area chart using hvplot (interactive) and matplotlib(static)
- export to html and pdf

### Second draft
- sample for the past 10 years instead of 1, createing new mins, mean and max values
- repeat for multiple countries
